Key Hyperparameters
Gamma (𝛾 γ): Discount factor for future rewards.
Tau (𝜏 τ): Parameter for soft updates of the target network.
Epsilon (𝜖 ϵ): Controls exploration vs. exploitation.
Learning Rate (𝛼 α): Step size for updating network weights.
Batch Size: Number of samples per training batch.
Buffer Size: Capacity of the replay buffer.
Update Frequency: Frequency of updating the target network.

Optimization Methods
Random Search: Randomly sample hyperparameter values within specified ranges and evaluate performance. This can be more efficient than grid search, especially when some hyperparameters have less impact than others.
Grid Search: Exhaustively search over a specified set of hyperparameter values. This is more systematic but can be computationally expensive.
Bayesian Optimization: Use probabilistic models to find the optimal hyperparameters more efficiently by focusing on promising regions of the hyperparameter space.
