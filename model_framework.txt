Certainly! To implement a multi-output neural network model in PyTorch that predicts three different aspects of a Yahtzee game — dice to keep, optimal scoring choice, and end game score — we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Model Architecture**: Create a PyTorch model with shared layers and separate branches for each output.

2. **Define the Loss Functions**: Since each output might have a different nature (e.g., classification or regression), we'll need appropriate loss functions for each.

3. **Training Loop**: Implement the training loop, where the model is trained on the training data and the losses are combined.

Let's start by creating a simplified example of this model.

### 1. Define the Model Architecture

We'll create a simple model with a shared layer and three separate branches:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class YahtzeeModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(YahtzeeModel, self).__init__()
        # Shared layers
        self.shared_layer = nn.Linear(input_features, 128)  # adjust input_features as needed

        # Branch for dice to keep (Binary classification for each dice)
        self.dice_branch = nn.Linear(128, 5)  # Output 5 values representing 5 dice

        # Branch for optimal scoring choice (Multiclass classification)
        self.score_branch = nn.Linear(128, num_scoring_categories)  # adjust num_scoring_categories

        # Branch for end game score (Regression)
        self.score_regression_branch = nn.Linear(128, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Shared layers
        x = F.relu(self.shared_layer(x))

        # Branch outputs
        dice_output = torch.sigmoid(self.dice_branch(x))  # Sigmoid for binary classification
        score_output = self.score_branch(x)  # Raw logits for multiclass classification
        score_regression_output = self.score_regression_branch(x)  # Linear output for regression

        return dice_output, score_output, score_regression_output
```

### 2. Define the Loss Functions

We'll need different loss functions for each branch:

```python
# Binary cross-entropy for the dice branch
dice_loss_fn = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

# Cross-entropy for the scoring choice branch
score_loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Mean squared error for the end game score branch
score_regression_loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
```

### 3. Training Loop

The training loop will involve calculating the loss for each branch and combining them:

```python
# Assuming you have a DataLoader named 'train_loader'
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for data, dice_target, score_target, score_regression_target in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        dice_output, score_output, score_regression_output = model(data)

        # Calculate losses
        dice_loss = dice_loss_fn(dice_output, dice_target)
        score_loss = score_loss_fn(score_output, score_target)
        score_regression_loss = score_regression_loss_fn(score_regression_output, score_regression_target)

        # Combine losses - you can also weight these differently if needed
        combined_loss = dice_loss + score_loss + score_regression_loss

        # Backward pass and optimize
        combined_loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

In this example:
- `input_features` should be set to the number of features in your input data.
- `num_scoring_categories` should be set to the number of scoring categories in Yahtzee.
- `train_loader` is a PyTorch DataLoader that provides batches of data and corresponding targets for each output.
- Adjust `num_epochs` as needed for your training regimen.

This is a basic structure, and you might need to fine-tune the architecture, loss functions, and training loop based on your specific data and training requirements.
